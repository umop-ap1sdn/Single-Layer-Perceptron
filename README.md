# Single-Layer-Perceptron
A single layer perceptron is the most basic Neural Network Structure, consisting only of inputs and outputs (no hidden layers), capable of learning very basic concepts. This project is designed to demonstrate a single layer perceptron's ability to recognize a logical OR Gate.
